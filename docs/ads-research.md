## Geographic Considerations

Since HCMC Construction Tracker targets Vietnamese users:

### Traffic Value by Region
| Region | RPM Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| USA | 1.0x (baseline) | Highest advertiser demand |
| Europe | 0.6-0.8x | Strong but lower than US |
| Vietnam | 0.15-0.3x | Lower advertiser demand |
| Other SEA | 0.2-0.4x | Emerging markets |

### Impact on Revenue
- **With majority Vietnamese traffic:** Expect RPMs at the lower end of ranges
- **Estimated effective RPM:** $1-8 depending on provider
- **Consider:** Local ad networks or direct partnerships with Vietnamese construction/real estate companies

---

## When to Start Showing Ads

### Minimum Viable Traffic
To make ads worthwhile (covering setup effort and UX impact):

| Goal | Minimum Pageviews | Expected Revenue |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Cover hosting costs | 5,000/month | ~$30-50/month |
| Meaningful income | 25,000/month | ~$150-300/month |
| Part-time income | 100,000/month | ~$600-1,500/month |
| Full-time income | 500,000+/month | ~$3,000-10,000/month |

### Recommendation for This Project
**Start with ads when:**
1. You have at least **5,000 pageviews/month** (makes it worth the effort)
2. You have **consistent traffic** for 2-3 months
3. You've established your **core user experience**
4. You have **analytics tracking** to measure impact

## Ad Placement Strategy for HCMC Construction Tracker

### Recommended Placements (Non-Intrusive)

1. **Sidebar on Detail Pages**
   - Location: Below mini-map
   - Size: 300x250 (Medium Rectangle)
   - Why: Doesn't interfere with content consumption

2. **In-Content on Detail Pages**
   - Location: Between timeline and references
   - Size: 336x280 or native
   - Why: Natural content break

3. **Footer Banner**
   - Location: Above footer
   - Size: 728x90 (Leaderboard)
   - Why: Non-intrusive, visible on all pages

4. **Search Results (Optional)**
   - Location: Every 5th result in list
   - Size: Native ad format
   - Why: Matches content style

### Placements to Avoid
- **Map overlay ads** - Would ruin core UX
- **Pop-ups** - Increases bounce rate
- **Auto-play video ads** - Annoying for users
- **Interstitials** - Bad for mobile users

---

## Alternative Monetization Options

Since traffic from Vietnam has lower ad value, consider:

1. **Direct Sponsorships**
   - Partner with Vietnamese construction companies
   - Real estate developers
   - Construction material suppliers
   - Higher CPM than programmatic ads

2. **Premium Features**
   - Advanced filtering
   - Email alerts for new projects
   - API access for developers

3. **Affiliate Marketing**
   - Real estate platforms
   - Construction services
   - Maps/navigation apps

4. **Donations/Memberships**
   - Community-supported model
   - Patreon or Ko-fi
